# OpenTale
PoC of an Cross Platform Open Source NosTale Client
---
This repo will hold an Open Source Rewrite of the NosTale Client.
For now, It'll just implement basic features without NetCode(GUI, Map and Entity Rendering, some other stuff), but when the basic stuff is done, NetCode Handling will follow.
The aim of this Client is to bring a Wirkung NosTale Client to Non-Windows platforms and to probably even bring it to mobile devices(although there's no plan for it for now). It will make it possible to play the game on Linux and Mac OS X without Lags in DirectX and graphic Glitches in OGL.
